For A2Q1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/xnjmSLIfS In this sketch I called for my profile picture but I orgainized it into functions I called 5 functions, one for each line because each line are in functions now, I makes it easier to edit by each row instead of doing each individual square

For A2Q2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/FihEPOezz In this sketch I created a custom shape buy using the begin shape mathod which makes it eassir to create different shapes. In my sketch I created a red 8 pointed star. 

For A2Q3: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/iH7n9T8DH. This sketch uses the same code to create a 8 pointed star and i also created a function that creates a identical 8 point star but in a different position and shape.  

For A2Q4: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/4zjyk4_KO For this sketch I merged two different flags into one. Palestine flag and The Washington state flag.  Instead of the red triangle on the palestine flag I took the baby blue and yellow from the Washington state flag and replaced the red in the triangle.
